# Exploring-weather-Trend-
Summary:
In this project, i have analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends where i live to overall global temperature trends.
This project was done under a Nanodegree program of udacity.

**Following were the Instructions provided:**

Your goal will be to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live. To do this, you’ll follow the steps below:

**1)** Extract the data from the database. To interact with the database,an SQL query was written.
        Write a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.
        Write a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.
**2)** Open up the CSV in whatever tool you feel most comfortable using. 
**3)** Create a line chart that compares your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. Make sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable 
**4)** Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends. Here are some questions to get you started.
        Is your city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
        “How do the changes in your city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?”
        What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few               hundred years?
